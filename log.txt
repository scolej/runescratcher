Added unit tracking with a hash map.

How to do `hash-update key fun` so that you only compute the
hash once? (Instead of `hash-ref` and then `hash-set`.)

The current way of testing is crappy.

- Multiple things are creeping into a single assertion.
- Describing a single assertion every time is overkill.

Way forward:

- A library of methods which produce descriptive failures: assertion library.
- Groupings of actions and assertions into test-cases.
- A way to run the cases easily.

A world & a moving @!

Next:

- Load a world of walls from a text file.
- Simple creature AI?

Some handy methods?

- call-with-file-contents

  just read a file competely and call a procedure

Next:

- separate tests & code?

  or maybe just a way to load without running?
  a macro which emits nothing if inhibit-tests is defined?
